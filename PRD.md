## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview

A comprehensive crypto trading management application that provides CRUD operations for cryptocurrency trading through the Bitvavo API, with extensibility for multiple exchange providers. The application offers real-time market data visualization, technical analysis with configurable indicators, automated trading capabilities including stop-losses and take-profits, DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategies, and portfolio management. Initially built for personal use with scalable architecture to support future commercialization. The application integrates both crypto market data and traditional economic indicators (PPI, CPI, inflation, rate cuts) to provide comprehensive market analysis.

### 1.2 Key Objectives

- Enable automated trading with advanced order types (stop-loss, take-profit) through API integration, primarily starting with Bitvavo
- Provide comprehensive market analysis through configurable technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, Volume, ATR, Bollinger Bands)
- Deliver real-time market insights combining crypto data with traditional economic indicators from the US market

### 1.3 Success Metrics

- Successful execution of automated trading strategies with configurable stop-losses and take-profits
- Real-time processing and visualization of market data and technical indicators
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS Monterey, iOS, web browsers) with local deployment capability

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Challenges

Bitvavo, while providing a solid API for basic trading operations, lacks built-in support for advanced automated trading features such as stop-losses, take-profits, and sophisticated trading strategies. Additionally, most crypto trading platforms don't integrate traditional economic indicators that significantly impact crypto markets, requiring traders to use multiple separate tools and platforms to get a complete market picture.

### 2.2 Target Pain Points

- Lack of automated stop-loss and take-profit functionality on Bitvavo platform
- Need to manually monitor multiple technical indicators across different interfaces
- Absence of integrated economic data (PPI, CPI, inflation, rate cuts) in crypto trading platforms
- Complexity of setting up and managing DCA strategies manually
- Limited portfolio management tools that combine technical analysis with automated execution

### 2.3 Market Opportunity

The crypto trading tool market is growing rapidly, with individual traders seeking more sophisticated automation and analysis tools. There's a gap in the market for platforms that combine crypto trading with traditional economic indicators, especially for users who want local deployment and full control over their trading strategies. The scalable architecture allows for future expansion to serve the broader retail crypto trading community.
